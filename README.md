# Aim
We aimed to improve StackGAN-v2 further to generate more accurate results in a different dataset that they used. We have produced three models based on StackGAN-v2 architecture.

# Test Results
We first trained the StackGAN-v2 with CUB dataset, which was also the dataset of the implementers of StackGAN-v2 has used in their paper results. Then, we tested the original architecture with LSUN classroom dataset. After getting the results, we tested the same dataset with our three model. Since the training time of these models require many hours, we focused on results from small number of epochs. In addition to that, we also trained MobileNet-v2 with CelebA dataset. The results we obtained are below.
